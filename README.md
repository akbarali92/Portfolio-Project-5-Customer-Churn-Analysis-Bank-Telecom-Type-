 📊 Customer Churn Analysis (Bank / Telecom Type)
 
 🔹 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for companies like banks and telecom providers. Losing customers directly impacts revenue and growth. This project analyzes customer behavior to identify patterns that lead to churn and helps businesses take preventive actions.

The goal of this project is to explore customer data, calculate churn rate, and discover the key factors responsible for customers leaving the company.

🔹 Business Problem

Companies want to answer the following questions:

* How many customers are leaving?
* What type of customers are more likely to churn?
* Does balance, salary, or activity level affect churn?
* Is churn higher in a specific gender or age group?
* How can we reduce customer churn?

🔹 Dataset Information

The dataset contains customer information such as:

* CustomerID — Unique customer identifier
* Gender — Male / Female
* Age — Customer age
* Balance — Account balance
* EstimatedSalary — Customer salary estimate
* IsActiveMember — Whether customer is active (1) or not (0)
* Churn — Whether customer left the company (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

* SQL — Data exploration and analysis
* Power BI — Dashboard creation and visualization
* Excel — Initial data understanding (optional)

🔹 Project Steps

 Step 1 — Data Understanding

* Loaded dataset into SQL database
* Checked number of rows and columns
* Understood meaning of each variable

 Step 2 — Data Cleaning

* Verified missing values
* Checked data types
* Ensured numeric columns were correct
* Removed duplicates (if any)

 Step 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

Performed analysis using SQL queries:

* Total customers
* Total churn customers
* Churn rate calculation
* Churn by gender
* Churn by age group
* Churn by activity status
* Balance and salary comparison

Step 4 — Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Created an interactive dashboard with:

* KPI Cards:

  * Total Customers
  * Churn Customers
  * Churn Rate %

* Visualizations:

  * Churn by Gender (Bar Chart)
  * Churn by Age (Column Chart)
  * Active vs Churn (Pie Chart)
  * Balance vs Salary vs Churn (Scatter Plot)

* Filters:

  * Gender slicer

🔹 Key Insights

Some important findings from analysis:

* Customers with low activity status are more likely to churn.
* Certain age groups show higher churn risk.
* Balance alone does not strongly predict churn.
* Both male and female customers show churn behavior, but distribution varies.
* Churn rate is around 27%, which is significant for business.

🔹 Business Recommendations

Based on insights:

* Improve engagement programs for inactive customers.
* Offer personalized benefits for high-risk age groups.
* Provide loyalty rewards to long-term customers.
* Monitor customer activity to detect churn early.
* Build predictive models to identify churn probability.
